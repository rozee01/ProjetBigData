# Local Vibes – Music Trends by City  
**Big Data Architecture Project**  
*Streaming + Batch Processing + Real-Time Dashboarding*  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
**Goal**: Compare musical tastes and listening habits across cities/countries by analyzing **Twitter (streaming) + Spotify (batch) data**.  

**Key Features**:  
- Real-time heatmap of trending genres per city.  
- Identification of local artists gaining traction.  
- "Genre battle" visualization (e.g., Pop vs. Rap vs. Rock).

## 🛠️ Step 1: Foundational Setup  
## 📊 Data Pipeline

Our data pipeline consists of two main flows:

### Twitter Data Flow (Streaming)
1. Capture tweets with geolocation and music-related content
2. Process through Kafka streams
3. Analyze in real-time with Spark Streaming
4. Enrich with geographical and music metadata
5. Store in time-series and data warehouse

### Spotify Data Flow (Batch)
1. Daily extraction of top charts by country
2. Process and transform with Spark batch jobs
3. Join with Twitter data for enhanced insights
4. Generate aggregated metrics and trends
5. Update dashboard visualizations
